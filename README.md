&lt;Quotation here&gt;

MAN

(VOICE OVER)

There are greater and lesser

gods in this world.

As I see them… they are no gods

at all but demons disguised in

divine masks, luring us into

slavery and oblivion.

My personal god is one of the

greater ones.

It’s the drug.

2.

The pilot episode of Society series called Rosenbergia

dwells on the connections between the human behaviour and

natural environment. Between religion, faith and our modern

absolute atheism. Why people in the past used to go to the

woods and sacrifice goods for their gods, cast spells and

perform rituals while now people don’t even go to the

church and pray? What happened?

Marshall Rosenberg’s psychology of non-violent

communication leads us into a discussion whether the

divergence of modern society from the activities of early

worshippers is a good way to go. Faith is dead.

Rosenbergia analyses the bonds between earth worshipping

pagan rituals and … to have a belief in something important

like a religion.

Dramatis Personae

Anna Prist – a young, 20 years old woman with a lifelong

interest in witchcraft and related stuff like Wicca, pagan

circles etc. She never actually believed in that stuff

until the moment she performed a ritual at the forest,

which turned out to have rather unnerving effect.

Prologue

EXT. DEEP SUMMER FOREST – DAY

We are standing in a vast, incredibly dense forest,

surrounded by the symptoms of a hot summer in its full

blast. We are overlooking a valley.

We see a deep green and rather dark forest with tall trees

and bushes swirling beneath a heavily tree-dimmed sky.

Streams of light keep pouring down to the ground.

MAN (VO)

We are inexplicably drawn to the

rigid and at the same time vague

5.

structures society creates. In a

true society there is no

beginning and there is no end.

In some societies it is past

that is important. In some it’s

its quite the opposite. However

administration structures want

us to believe there is only here

and now. No past, no future.

Just now. That’s why it’s so

compelling. You don’t have to

worry. You don’t have to think

about what to do tomorrow. It is

all programmed, scheduled. You

just go and do your job. Here

and now. No questions asked, no

doubts raised. Communication at

its best.

The consequences of seeing the

surrounding world in such a way

are enormous.

What happens if you lose your

insight and willingness to

conform? What happens when you

reach out to the spheres of

being you haven’t even known

they existed?
